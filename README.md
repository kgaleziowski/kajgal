### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kajetan and I am 22 years old. I am passionate about math and computer science.
I have commerical experience working with .NET and Oracle databases but I use a lot of other technologies for my private projects, for example I am developing mobile applications in my free time. I believe that I have enough experience to smoothly move from technology to technology depending on the project needs.

Programming tastes bitter, especially when you are diabetic ðŸ˜œ.
